# appointment-picker

To build locally:

- have nodejs installed, e.g. with https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- I'm currently on nodejs v18.13.0, any v18 version should work
- clone the project, change into the root folder
- `$ npm install`
- `$ npm run start` to run locally for development
- `$ npm run build` to build
- build result in `build/css/*.css` and `build/js/*.js` (only one file each) can be copied over to be used in another project
